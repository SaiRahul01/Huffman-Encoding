Huffman Encoding is a Lossless Compression Algorithm used to compress the data. It is an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper “A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes”.

As it can be understood from being a “Compression Technique”, the aim is to encode the same data in a way that takes up less space. Accordingly, when a data is encoded with Huffman Coding, we get a unique code for each symbol in the data. For example the string “ABC” occupies 3 bytes without any compression. Let’s assume while the character A is given the code 00, the character B is given the code 01, the character C is given the code 10 as the result of encoding. To store the same data, we would only need to use 6 bits instead of 3 bytes.
